      (or heatmap) is a chart type that shows the magnitude of a numeric

      //
      // Data
      //
      */}
      <h2 id="data">The Data</h2>
      <p>
        The dataset is usually an <b>array</b> where each item provides
        information for a <b>cell</b> of the heatmap.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each item is an <b>object</b> that requires at least a{" "}
        <code>value</code> property that is a <b>number</b>. This number will be
        used to color the cell.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each item also requires a <code>x</code> and a <code>y</code> property,
        providing the position of the cell in the 2-d space. Note that those
        values are <b>strings</b> since anything can be used. We are dealing
        with <b>ordinal scales</b> here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that you can add any kind of information in those cell objects.
        Such information can be included in tooltips later on.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Here is a minimal example of the data structure:</p>
      <CodeBlock code={snippet1} />

      {/*
      //
      // Skeleton
      //
      */}
      <h2 id="skeleton">Component skeleton</h2>
      <p>
        The goal here is to create a <code>Heatmap</code> component that will be
        stored in a <code>Heatmap.tsx</code> file. This component requires 3
        props to render: a <code>width</code>, a <code>height</code>, and some{" "}
        <code>data</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The shape of the <code>data</code> is described above. The{" "}
        <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> will be used to rendering a{" "}
        <code>svg</code> element in the DOM, in which we will insert the
        heatmap.
      </p>
      <p>
        To put it in a nutshell, that's the skeleton of our <code>Heatmap</code>{" "}
        component:
      </p>
      <CodeBlock code={snippetSkeleton} />
      <p>
        It's fundamental to understand that with this code organization, d3.js
        will be used to prepare the svg <code>rect</code>, but it's react that
        will render them in the <code>return()</code> statement. We won't use d3
        methods like <code>append</code> that you can find in usual{" "}
        <a href="https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com">d3.js examples</a>.
      </p>

      {/*
      //
      // Scales
      //
      */}
      <h2 id="Scales">Scales</h2>
      <p>
        We need a way to translate a group pair of the dataset (e.g. row of
        group <code>A</code>, column of group <code>C</code>) in a 2d coordinate
        (e.g. <i>x=103px</i>, <i>y=300px</i>). This is a concept called{" "}
        <b>scaling</b>.
      </p>
      <h3>&rarr; Data wrangling</h3>
      <p>
        Before building scales we need an exhaustive list of all groups
        displayed on the X and Y axes. We also need to compute the <b>min</b>{" "}
        and <b>max</b> of the <b>value</b> property to compute the color scale.
      </p>
      <p>
        As always, don't forget to wrap that kind of work in a{" "}
        <code>useMemo</code>. You want to compute it only when the{" "}
        <code>data</code> changes. This is how the computation looks like:
      </p>
      <CodeBlock code={snippetAllGroups} />
      <h3>&rarr; X and Y Scales</h3>
      <p>
        The X and Y scale are{" "}
        <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-scale#scaleBand">band scales</a>,
        computed with the <code>scaleBand()</code> function of d3.js. It means
        that a band of pixels is attributed to each group.
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance, calling a the x scale with <code>xScale("A")</code> will
        return <code>0</code>, and <code>xScale.bandwidth()</code> will return
        the width of the band (e.g. <code>11px</code>).
      </p>
      <CodeBlock code={snippetXScale} />
      <p>
        The <code>padding</code> is the space assigned between each band
        (=between each cell).
      </p>
      <p>
        You can learn more about scales{" "}
        <a href="https://d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/custom_axis.html">here</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>&rarr; Color scale</h3>
      <p>
        The color scale of a heatmap is <b>tricky</b> to compute. We encode a{" "}
        <b>numeric variable</b> that can have any kind of distribution to a{" "}
        <b>color</b>, and that's not an easy step.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fortunately{" "}
        <a href="https://d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/custom_color.html">d3.js</a>{" "}
        (as always) has some life-saving utils to help. For instance, a
        sequential color scale can be applied with{" "}
        <code>scaleSequential()</code> together with the <code>inferno</code>{" "}
        color palette. Many other options could make sense, but that deserves
        its own blogpost.

      <h2 id="rectangles">Add rectangles, get a basic react heatmap</h2>
      <p>Finally! ü§™</p>
      <p>
        With the scales available, rendering is just a matter of mapping through
        the dataset and creating a set of svg <code>rect</code> for each cell.
      </p>
      <p>Something like:</p>
      <CodeBlock code={snippetRender} />
      <p>
        Note that for the X and Y axis labels, just adding a set of svg{" "}
        <code>text</code> element does a pretty good job, so no need to build
        complicated axis components as for a{" "}
        <a href="https://www.react-graph-gallery.com/scatter-plot">

        That's it, we have a first good looking <b>heatmap</b>!

        it with <b>d3.js only</b>. (Check the pure d3 implementation{" "}

      <AccordionSection title={"Adding a tooltip"} startOpen={true}>
        <p>
          The tooltip is a must have for a heatmap. It allows to get as much
          detail as needed for each cell. It's not an easy task though. There
          are several strategies described more in depth here, but here is what
          I suggest in the following example:
        </p>
        <h3>&rarr; Two layers: renderer and tooltip</h3>
        <p>
          The first task is to split the <code>Heatmap</code> component in 2
          layers. The first layer called <code>Renderer</code> will render the
          cells as seen previously. The second is an <code>absolute</code> div
          put on top of the first one, used only to show the tooltip{" "}
          <code>div</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This way, the x & y coordinates of cells in the first layer correspond
          with the second layer.
        </p>
        <CodeBlock code={snippet4} />

        <h3>&rarr; A common state</h3>
        <p>
          On top of the 2 layers we need a state that stores information about
          the cell being hovered over. You can create it with a{" "}
          <code>useState</code>
          statement.
        </p>
        <p>
          The state can now be passed to the <code>Tooltip</code> layer. The
          function to update it can be passed to the <code>Renderer</code> layer
          that will update it when a cell is hovered over.
        </p>
        <CodeBlock code={snippet5} />

        <h3>&rarr; Hover, update state, render tooltips</h3>
        <p>
          The heatmap cells listen to <code>onMouseEnter</code> events and
          update the tooltip state with accurate coordinates when it happens.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tooltip renders a div at the right position thanks to those
          informations.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is much more to say about those parts, but it deserves its own
          blog post since it's then used for all chart types.

        <p>
          It was necessary to tweak the color scale, switching to a square
          transformation with <code>scaleSequentialSqrt</code>. This allows to
          give less importance the extreme values that would absorb the
          variation otherwise.
