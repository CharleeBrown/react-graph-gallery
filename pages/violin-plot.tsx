        A violin chart allows to visualize the distribution of one or several
        groups. Here, groups are spread on the X axis, when the Y axis
        represents the numeric value.

          The dataset used to build a violin chart is usually an array of
          object. For each object, a <code>name</code> property provides the
          group name, and a <code>value</code> property provides the numeric
          value. It basically looks like this:

          <u>Note</u>: violin plots are useful for big datasets. If you have
          less than ~100 data points, you probably better have to build a{" "}

        <p>
          The process to build a violin chart with d3.js is described in depth
          in the{" "}
          <a href="https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/violin">d3 graph gallery</a>
          . Let's remind the most important steps:
        </p>

        <h3>
          &rarr; slice the data with <code>d3.bin()</code>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Each violin represents the distribution of an array of numerical
          values. The first step to get there is to split the values in several
          bins and count how many values are in each bin. This is possible
          thanks to the <code>bin()</code> function:
        </p>
        <CodeBlock code={snippet2} />
        <p>
          The result (<code>bins</code>) in an array. Each item is an array that
          represents a bin and contains all the values inside this bins. It also
          have 2 additional properties x0 and x1 that are the bin boundaries.
        </p>

        <h3>
          &rarr; build the svg path with <code>d3.area()</code> and{" "}
          <code>curve()</code>
        </h3>
        <p>
          The bins object is all we need to draw an histogram since the{" "}
          <code>length</code>
          of each bin is the actual size of the bar. This is possible thanks to
          the <code>area()</code> function that can be called as follow. Last
          but not leas the curve() call adds some smoothing to the shape,
          transforming the histogram in a smooth density:
        </p>
        <CodeBlock code={snippet3} />

        <br />
        <TakeHome>
          We now have the logic to build a svg path for a violin from an array
          of values. Let's render it with react.
        </TakeHome>
      </AccordionSection>

      <AccordionSection
        title={"Rendering a basic violin chart with React"}
        startOpen={true}
      >
        <p>
          There is nothing special to notice concerning the rendering. Each
          violin svg path built is passed to a svg <code>path</code> element in
          its <code>d</code> attribute.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that in the example below I'm using d3 to render the axes, not
          react. This will be discussed more in depth in a blogpost.
