      <h2 id="data">The Data</h2>
      <p>
        The dataset used to build a scatterplot is usually an{" "}
        <b>array of objects</b>. For each object, at least 2 properties are
        required: <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>. The value of <code>x</code>{" "}
        will control the position of the datapoint on the horizontal axis,{" "}
        <code>y</code> on the vertical one.
      </p>
      <CodeBlock code={snippet1} />
      <p>
        We will see later in this guide that some additional properties can
        become useful. For instance, a third numeric value could be added as a{" "}
        <code>size</code> property, and a categorical property could be used as
        a <code>group</code> to control the <b>color</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This tutorial starts by using dummy data for the most simple examples.
        It then uses the famous{" "}
        <a href="https://www.data-to-viz.com/story/ThreeNum.html">gapminder</a>{" "}
        dataset that provides the <b>life expectancy</b> and the{" "}
        <b>population size</b> for every country.
      </p>

      {/*

      <h2 id="Scales and axes">Scales and axes</h2>
      <h3>&rarr; Scales</h3>
      <p>
        Building a scatterplot requires to transform a <b>dimension</b> (a
        numeric variable like life expectancy) in a <b>position in pixels</b>.
        This is done using a fundamental dataviz concept called <b>scale</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        D3.js comes with a handful set of{" "}
        <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-scale">predefined scales</a>.{" "}
        <code>scaleLinear</code> is what we need for the X and Y axis. Here is a
        quick overview on how to build and use a scale:
      </p>
      <CodeBlock code={snippet5} />

      <h3>&rarr; Axes</h3>
      <p>
        Axes are rather complicated elements. They are composed of a main{" "}
        <b>segment</b>, several <b>ticks</b> that each have a <b>label</b>, and
        often are decorated with a <b>title</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        D3.js offers some powerful{" "}
        <a href="https://d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/custom_axis.html">
          functions
        </a>{" "}
        to draw those axes for you, based on the scales discussed above. For
        instance, one could call <code>axisBottom()</code> in a{" "}
        <code>useEffect</code> hook to imperatively draw the X axis into a
        specific DOM element. But this comes with a number of caveats and is
        thus not the option used in this gallery.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead, I suggest to create the axes from scratch and store them in 2
        react components called <code>AxisBottom</code> and{" "}
        <code>AxisLeft</code>. Those components expect a d3 scale as input and
        does all the svg drawing for us.

          </p>
        }
      />
      <p>
        The code for those X and Y axis components is provided below. The
        following examples will show how straightforward it is to tweak them to
        reach other <b>chart styles</b>.

        <br />
        <u>Note</u>: do not forget to use the <code>crispEdges</code> value of
        the <code>shape-rendering</code> svg attribute. Otherwise the vertical
        and horizontal segments might be blurry.

      //

      <h2 id="Add markers">Add circles</h2>
      <p>
        We are now pretty close from a first scatterplot. There is just one more
        critical part missing: <b>markers</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To add them, we have to <code>map()</code> on the data input and add a
        svg <code>circle</code> for each. That's the code snippet that needs to
        be added:
      </p>
      <CodeBlock code={snippet4} />
      <p>
        <b>That's it!</b> üéâ
      </p>
      <p>
        Calling the <code>allShapes</code> object in the <code>return()</code>{" "}
        statement of the component will add as many circles as needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that styling attributes are written as prop here. In production,
        you should consider adding a <code>class</code> to those circles and
        setting it using css.

        first working version.

      <h2 id="Tooltips">Tooltips</h2>
      <p>
        There is a very common <b>frustration</b> with scatterplots: you're
        interested in a specific data points (let's say it's out of the general
        trend for instance), but you <b>ignore everything</b> about this item.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is when tooltips come into play. You can add as much information as
        you want in it, making the chart much more insightful.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the following chart based on the{" "}
        <a href="https://www.data-to-viz.com/story/ThreeNum.html">gapminder</a>{" "}
        dataset, don't you want to know what are the countries with the highest
        life expectancy or GDP per capita? Labeling all circles would result in
        a very <b>cluttered</b> figure, so let's learn how to add tooltips
        instead.
      </p>
      <ChartOrSandbox
        VizComponent={ScatterplotTooltipDemo}
        vizName={"ScatterplotTooltipDemo"}
        maxWidth={500}
        height={500}
        caption="Hover effect"
      />
      <p>
        There are <b>many different approaches</b> to build tooltips, and one
        can even build it using{" "}
        <a href="https://blog.logrocket.com/creating-beautiful-tooltips-with-only-css/">
          css only
        </a>
        . But in my experience the best way to build it concists in the
        following:
      </p>

      {/*
      //
      // Hover effects
      //
      */}
      <h2 id="Hover effect">Hover effect</h2>
      <p>
        Showing a tooltip on hover is definitely helpful, but it's often a nice
        touch to add a <b>hover effect</b>. Hover effects on scatterplots are
        usually used for 2 main reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Highlight <b>one circle</b>: makes sure the tooltip you're reading is
          associated with the circle you're targeting.
        </li>
        <li>
          Highlight <b>a group</b>: it's often interesting to see all the
          related points in the dataset.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Let's implement both on the chart below. Hovering over a country will
        fade all circles except the ones of the same continent.
      </p>
      <ChartOrSandbox

        maxWidth={500}
        height={500}
        caption="Hover effect"
      />
      <p>
        Explains how it works: internal state. Dim other dots. Gray scale.
        Animation in one direction only.
      </p>
      <p>So much more to say: deserves its own blogpost.</p>

      <h2 id="real life">Real life application</h2>
      <p>Let's apply the concepts learnt above on a real life example.</p>
      <p>
        I really like this scatterplot originally published on the data wrapper
        blog. It shows a strong correlation between vulnerability to climate
        change and CO2 emissions.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The chart has several features that are interesting to reproduce on a
        technical point of view:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Custom <b>annotation</b>: only a fraction of the country names are
          written
        </li>
        <li>
          Hover effect: hovered country is highlighted with a black stroke.
          After a short delay, countries of other groups are dimmed. Note that
          the effect is triggered once the mouse approaches the marker, no need
          to be perfectly on top.
        </li>
        <li>Tooltip: highly customized and linked to mouse position</li>
      </ul>
